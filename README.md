# **Pet App**

A virtual pet inspired by the classic pocket consoles of the 1980s. This simple browser-based game allows users to care for a pet by feeding and playing with it. The pet's hunger and happiness levels change over time, just like the classic virtual pets of the past.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Pet**: The pet displays different emotions using PNG images based on its hunger and happiness levels.
- **Feed and Play**: Users can interact with the pet by feeding or playing with it, affecting its stats in real-time.
- **Simple Game Loop**: Hunger increases and happiness decreases over time, creating a simple and engaging gameplay loop.
- **Retro-style UI**: A user interface inspired by 1980s pocket consoles, featuring retro visuals and interaction styles.

## **Technologies Used**

- **ReactJS**: The app is built using ReactJS, leveraging its component-based structure for modularity and scalability.
- **PNG Images**: The pet’s emotional states are represented with PNG images, replacing text-based emojis.
- **HTML/CSS**: Basic layout and styling for the retro look and feel.

## **Future Features (Planned)**

- **Persistence**: Add the ability to save the pet’s state using `localStorage` or a backend, allowing users to return to their pet later.
- **Additional Actions**: Introduce more interactive activities like sleeping or teaching the pet new tricks.
- **Sound Effects and Animations**: Enhance the pet’s emotional states with retro-style sound effects and basic animations.
- **Mobile Support**: Optimize the app for mobile devices.
